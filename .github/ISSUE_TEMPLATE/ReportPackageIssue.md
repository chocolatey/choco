STOP RIGHT HERE - DO NOT CREATE A TICKET FOR PACKAGES ON THIS REPOSITORY

This is the repository for choco.exe, the command line interface for Chocolatey, and issues/feature suggestions should be limited to only choco. For a package failure, typically you would be reporting an issue with a package on the community package repository, which is not what this repository represents. In fact, the community repository and all of its packages represents about 5% of the packages in existence and less than half of the usage of choco itself. 

  In other words Chocolatey != Chocolatey.org Packages.

For all things packages, you have two routes:

1. If you are having issue with a package or you want to see an enhancement, please see https://chocolatey.org/docs/package-triage-process (Package Triage Process / Becoming a maintainer of existing packages).
2. If you are looking for packages to be added to the community package repository (aka https://chocolatey.org/packages), please see https://chocolatey.org/docs/package-triage-process#package-request-package-missing (Package Requests).



NOTE: Keep in mind we have an etiquette regarding communication that we expect folks to observe when they are looking for support in the Chocolatey community. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/README.md#etiquette-regarding-communication
