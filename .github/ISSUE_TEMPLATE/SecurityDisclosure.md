STOP RIGHT HERE - DO NOT CREATE A TICKET FOR A SECURITY FINDING IN THE OPEN (HERE OR IN ANY COMMUNITY)

Security reports should never start out in the open. Please follow up directly with the team if you have a contact. If not you can always start with the information at https://chocolatey.org/security to see instructions on how to provide the disclosure. Thank you!
