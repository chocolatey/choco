<!--
When including the log information, please ensure you have run the command with --debug --verbose. It provides important information for determining an issue

- Make sure there is no sensitive data shared.
- We need ALL output, not just what you may believe is relevant.
- We need ALL OUTPUT (including the configuration information), see https://gist.github.com/ferventcoder/b1300b91c167c8ac8205#file-error-txt-L1-L41 for what we need.
- If it is hard to reproduce with debug/verbose, the log file already logs with those parameters, just grab the relevant section from the log file (in the logs directory of your Chocolatey install).
