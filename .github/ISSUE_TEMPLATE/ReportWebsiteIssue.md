STOP RIGHT HERE - DO NOT CREATE A TICKET FOR THE WEBSITE ON THIS REPOSITORY

This is the repository for choco.exe, the command line interface for Chocolatey, and issues/feature suggestions should be limited to only choco.

For Chocolatey Gallery aka Chocolatey Community Package Repository, you will need to head over to https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org and file a ticket there.



NOTE: Keep in mind we have an etiquette regarding communication that we expect folks to observe when they are looking for support in the Chocolatey community. https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/README.md#etiquette-regarding-communication
