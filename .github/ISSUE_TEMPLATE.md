- Make sure there is no sensitive data shared.
- We need ALL output, not just what you may believe is relevant.
- If it is hard to reproduce with debug/verbose, the log file already logs with those parameters, just grab the relevant section from the log file (in the logs directory of your Chocolatey install).
