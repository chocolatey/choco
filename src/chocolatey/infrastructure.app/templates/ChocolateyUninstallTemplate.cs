## NOTE: In 80-90% of the cases (95% with licensed versions due to Package Synchronizer and other enhancements), you may 
## not need this file due to AutoUninstaller. See https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-uninstall

## If this is an MSI, cleaning up comments is all you need.
## If this is an exe, change installerType and silentArgs
## Auto Uninstaller should be able to detect and handle registry uninstalls (if it is turned on, it is in preview for 0.9.9).
