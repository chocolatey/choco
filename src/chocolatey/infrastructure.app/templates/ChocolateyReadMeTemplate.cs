How do I create packages? See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages

If you are submitting packages to the community feed (https://community.chocolatey.org)
always try to ensure you have read, understood and adhere to the create
packages wiki link above.

## Automatic Packaging Updates?
Consider making this package an automatic package, for the best
maintainability over time. Read up at https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/automatic-packages

## Shim Generation
Any executables you include in the package or download (but don't call
install against using the built-in functions) will be automatically shimmed.

This means those executables will automatically be included on the path.
Shim generation runs whether the package is self-contained or uses automation
scripts.

By default, these are considered console applications.

If the application is a GUI, you should create an empty file next to the exe
named 'name.exe.gui' e.g. 'bob.exe' would need a file named 'bob.exe.gui'.
See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages#how-do-i-set-up-shims-for-applications-that-have-a-gui

If you want to ignore the executable, create an empty file next to the exe
named 'name.exe.ignore' e.g. 'bob.exe' would need a file named
'bob.exe.ignore'.
See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages#how-do-i-exclude-executables-from-getting-shims

## Self-Contained?
If you have a self-contained package, you can remove the automation scripts
entirely and just include the executables, they will automatically get shimmed,
which puts them on the path. Ensure you have the legal right to distribute
the application though. See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/information/legal.

You should read up on the Shim Generation section to familiarize yourself
on what to do with GUI applications and/or ignoring shims.

## Automation Scripts
You have a powerful use of Chocolatey, as you are using PowerShell. So you
can do just about anything you need. Choco has some very handy built-in
functions that you can use, these are sometimes called the helpers.

### Built-In Functions
https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions

A note about a couple:
* Get-BinRoot - this is a horribly named function that doesn't do what new folks think it does. It gets you the 'tools' root, which by default is set to 'c:\tools', not the chocolateyInstall bin folder - see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/get-toolslocation
* Install-BinFile - used for non-exe files - executables are automatically shimmed... - see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/install-binfile
* Uninstall-BinFile - used for non-exe files - executables are automatically shimmed - see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/uninstall-binfile

### Getting package specific information
Use the package parameters pattern - see https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/guides/create/parse-packageparameters-argument

### Need to mount an ISO?
https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/guides/create/mount-an-iso-in-chocolatey-package

### Environment Variables
Chocolatey makes a number of environment variables available (You can access any of these with $env:TheVariableNameBelow):

 * TEMP/TMP - Overridden to the CacheLocation, but may be the same as the original TEMP folder
 * ChocolateyInstall - Top level folder where Chocolatey is installed
 * ChocolateyPackageName - The name of the package, equivalent to the `<id />` field in the nuspec (0.9.9+)
 * ChocolateyPackageTitle - The title of the package, equivalent to the `<title />` field in the nuspec (0.10.1+)
 * ChocolateyPackageVersion - The version of the package, equivalent to the `<version />` field in the nuspec (0.9.9+)
 * ChocolateyPackageFolder - The top level location of the package folder  - the folder where Chocolatey has downloaded and extracted the NuGet package, typically `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\packageName`.

#### Advanced Environment Variables
The following are more advanced settings:

 * ChocolateyPackageParameters - Parameters to use with packaging, not the same as install arguments (which are passed directly to the native installer). Based on `--package-parameters`. (0.9.8.22+)
 * CHOCOLATEY_VERSION - The version of Choco you normally see. Use if you are 'lighting' things up based on choco version. (0.9.9+) - Otherwise take a dependency on the specific version you need.
 * ChocolateyForceX86 = If available and set to 'true', then user has requested 32bit version. (0.9.9+) - Automatically handled in built in Choco functions.
 * OS_PLATFORM - Like Windows, OSX, Linux. (0.9.9+)
 * OS_VERSION - The version of OS, like 6.1 something something for Windows. (0.9.9+)

#### Set By Options and Configuration
Some environment variables are set based on options that are passed, configuration and/or features that are turned on:

 * ChocolateyEnvironmentDebug - Was `--debug` passed? If using the built-in PowerShell host, this is always true (but only logs debug messages to console if `--debug` was passed) (0.9.10+)
