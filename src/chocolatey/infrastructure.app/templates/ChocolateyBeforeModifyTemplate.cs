#  need to uninstall an MSI prior to upgrade, put the functionality in this
#  file without calling the uninstall script. Make it idempotent in the
#  uninstall script so that it doesn't fail when it is already uninstalled.
# NOTE: For upgrades - like the uninstall script, this script always runs from 
#  the currently installed version, not from the new upgraded package version.
