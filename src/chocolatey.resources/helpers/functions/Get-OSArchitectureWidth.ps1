function Get-OSArchitectureWidth {
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Get the operating system architecture address width.

.DESCRIPTION
This will return the system architecture address width (probably 32 or
64 bit). If you pass a comparison, it will return true or false instead
of {`32`|`64`}.

.NOTES
When your installation script has to know what architecture it is run
on, this simple function comes in handy.

Available as `Get-OSArchitectureWidth` in 0.9.10+. If you need
compatibility with pre 0.9.10, please use the alias `Get-ProcessorBits`.

.INPUTS
None

.OUTPUTS
None

.PARAMETER Compare
This optional parameter causes the function to return $true or $false,
depending on wether or not the bit width matches.
