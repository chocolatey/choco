function Get-UninstallRegistryKey {
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Retrieve registry key(s) for system-installed applications from an 
exact or wildcard search.

.DESCRIPTION
This function will attempt to retrieve a matching registry key for an
already installed application, usually to be used with a 
chocolateyUninstall.ps1 automation script.

The function also prevents `Get-ItemProperty` from failing when 
handling wrongly encoded registry keys.

.NOTES
Available in 0.9.10+. If you need to maintain compatibility with pre
0.9.10, please add the following to your nuspec:

~~~xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency id="chocolatey-uninstall.extension" />
</dependencies>
~~~

.INPUTS
String

.OUTPUTS
This function searches registry objects and returns PSCustomObject of 
the matched key's properties.
  
Retrieve properties with dot notation, for example: 
`$key.UninstallString`


.PARAMETER SoftwareName
Part or all of the Display Name as you see it in Programs and Features.
It should be enough to be unique.

If the display name contains a version number, such as "Launchy 2.5", 
it is recommended you use a fuzzy search `"Launchy*"` (the wildcard `*`)
as if the version is upgraded or autoupgraded, suddenly the uninstall
script will stop working and it may not be clear as to what went wrong
at first.

.EXAMPLE
>
# Software name in Programs and Features is "Gpg4Win (2.3.0)"
[array]$key = Get-UninstallRegistryKey -SoftwareName "Gpg4win*"
$key.DisplayName

.EXAMPLE
>
# Software name is "Launchy 2.5"
[array]$key = Get-UninstallRegistryKey -SoftwareName "Launchy*"
$key.UninstallString

.EXAMPLE
> 
# Software name is "Mozilla Firefox"
[array]$key = Get-UninstallRegistryKey -SoftwareName "Mozilla Firefox"
$key.UninstallString
