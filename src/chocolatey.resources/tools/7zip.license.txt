    All copyrights to original unRAR code are owned by Alexander Roshal.

    The license for original unRAR code has the following restriction:

      The unRAR sources cannot be used to re-create the RAR compression algorithm,

      stated in the documentation and source comments that the code may
      not be used to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.
