# [DEPRECATED] Version Command (choco version)

**NOTE:** Version has been deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0.0. 

 If you are attempting to get local installed items, use 
 `choco list -lo`. 

 If you want to know what has available upgrades, use 
 `choco upgrade <pkg|all> -whatif` or [[`choco outdated`|Commandsoutdated]].

## Options and Switches

**NOTE:** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes [[default options/switches|CommandsReference#default-options-and-switches]] (included below for completeness).
