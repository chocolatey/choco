# List/Search Command (choco search)

Chocolatey will perform a search for a package local or remote. Some 
 may prefer to use [[`clist`|Commandslist]] as a shortcut for [[`choco list`|Commandslist]].

**NOTE:** 100% compatible with older Chocolatey client (0.9.8.x and below) 
 with options and switches. In most cases you can still pass options 
 and switches  with one dash (`-`). For more details, see 
 [[how to pass arguments|CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches]] (`choco -?`).

## Usage

    choco search <filter> [<options/switches>]
    choco list <filter> [<options/switches>]
    clist <filter> [<options/switches>]

## Examples

    choco list --local-only
    choco list -li
    choco list -lai
    choco list --page=0 --page-size=25
    choco search git
    choco search git -s "'https://somewhere/out/there'"
    choco search bob -s "'https://somewhere/protected'" -u user -p pass

## Alternative Sources
 
Available in 0.9.10+.

### WebPI
This specifies the source is Web PI (Web Platform Installer) and that 
 we are searching for a WebPI product, such as IISExpress. If you do 
 not have the Web PI command line installed, it will install that first 
 and then perform the search requested.
 e.g. `choco list --source webpi`

### Windows Features
This specifies that the source is a Windows Feature and we should 
 install via the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM) 
 on the local machine.
 e.g. `choco list --source windowsfeatures`

## Options and Switches

**NOTE:** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.
