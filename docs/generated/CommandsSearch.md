# List/Search Command (choco search)

Chocolatey will perform a search for a package local or remote. Some 
 may prefer to use [[`clist`|Commandslist]] as a shortcut for [[`choco list`|Commandslist]].

**NOTE:** 100% compatible with older Chocolatey client (0.9.8.x and below) 
 with options and switches. In most cases you can still pass options 
 and switches  with one dash (`-`). For more details, see 
 [[how to pass arguments|CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches]] (`choco -?`).

## Usage

    choco search <filter> [<options/switches>]
    choco list <filter> [<options/switches>]
    clist <filter> [<options/switches>]

## Examples

    choco list --local-only
    choco list -li
    choco list -lai
    choco list --page=0 --page-size=25
    choco search git
    choco search git --source="'https://somewhere/out/there'"
    choco search bob -s "'https://somewhere/protected'" -u user -p pass

**NOTE:** See scripting in [[how to pass arguments|CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches]] (`choco -?`) for how to 
 write proper scripts and integrations.


## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

Enhanced:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred
 - 2: no results (enhanced)

**NOTE:** Starting in v0.10.12, if you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes' 
 turned on, then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow 
 better integration and scripting.

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please 
 file a ticket so we can document it at 
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## See It In Action

![choco search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/chocolatey/choco/images/gifs/choco_search.gif)


## Alternative Sources
 
Available in 0.9.10+.

### WebPI
This specifies the source is Web PI (Web Platform Installer) and that 
 we are searching for a WebPI product, such as IISExpress. If you do 
 not have the Web PI command line installed, it will install that first 
 and then perform the search requested.
 e.g. `choco list --source webpi`

### Windows Features
This specifies that the source is a Windows Feature and we should 
 install via the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM) 
 on the local machine.
 e.g. `choco list --source windowsfeatures`

## Options and Switches

**NOTE:** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes [[default options/switches|CommandsReference#default-options-and-switches]] (included below for completeness).
