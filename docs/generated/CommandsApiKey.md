# ApiKey Command (choco apikey)

This lists api keys that are set or sets an api key for a particular   
 source so it doesn't need to be specified every time.

Anything that doesn't contain source and key will list api keys.

## Usage

    choco apikey [<options/switches>]
    choco setapikey [<options/switches>]

## Examples

    choco apikey
    choco apikey -s https://somewhere/out/there
    choco apikey -s="https://somewhere/out/there/" -k="value"
    choco apikey -s "https://push.chocolatey.org/" -k="123-123123-123"
    choco apikey -s "http://internal_nexus" -k="user:password"

For source location, this can be a folder/file share or an 
http location. When it comes to urls, they can be different from the packages 
url (where packages are searched and installed from). As an example, for 
Chocolatey's community package package repository, the package url is 
https://chocolatey.org/api/v2, but the push url is https://push.chocolatey.org 
(and the deprecated https://chocolatey.org/ as a push url). Check the 
documentation for your choice of repository to learn what the push url is. 

For the key, this can be an apikey that is provided by your source repository. 
With some sources, like Nexus, this can be a NuGet API key or it could be a 
user name and password specified as 'user:password' for the API key. Please see 
your repository's documentation (for Nexus, please see 
https://bit.ly/nexus2apikey).

**NOTE:** See scripting in [[how to pass arguments|CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches]] (`choco -?`) for how to 
 write proper scripts and integrations.


## Connecting to Chocolatey.org (Community Package Repository)

In order to save your API key for https://push.chocolatey.org/, 
 log in (or register, confirm and then log in) to
 https://push.chocolatey.org/, go to https://push.chocolatey.org/account, 
 copy the API Key, and then use it in the following command:

    choco apikey -k <your key here> -s https://push.chocolatey.org/


## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please 
 file a ticket so we can document it at 
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## Options and Switches

**NOTE:** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes [[default options/switches|CommandsReference#default-options-and-switches]] (included below for completeness).
