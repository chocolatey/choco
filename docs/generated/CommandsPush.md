# Push Command (choco push)

Chocolatey will attempt to push a compiled nupkg to a package feed. 
 Some may prefer to use `cpush` as a shortcut for `choco push`.

**NOTE:** 100% compatible with older chocolatey client (0.9.8.32 and below)
 with options and switches. Default push location is deprecated and 
 will be removed by v1. In most cases you can still pass options and 
 switches with one dash (`-`). For more details, see 
 [[how to pass arguments|CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches]] (`choco -?`).

A feed can be a local folder, a file share, the [community feed](https://chocolatey.org/packages) 
 (https://push.chocolatey.org/), or a custom/private feed. For web
 feeds, it has a requirement that it implements the proper OData
 endpoints required for NuGet packages.

## Usage

    choco push [<path to nupkg>] [<options/switches>]
    cpush [<path to nupkg>] [<options/switches>]

**NOTE:** If there is more than one nupkg file in the folder, the command 
 will require specifying the path to the file.

## Examples

    choco push --source https://chocolatey.org/
    choco push --source "'https://chocolatey.org/'" -t 500
    choco push --source "'https://chocolatey.org/'" -k="'123-123123-123'"

**NOTE:** See scripting in [[how to pass arguments|CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches]] (`choco -?`) for how to 
 write proper scripts and integrations.


## Troubleshooting

To use this command, you must have your API key saved for the community
 feed (chocolatey.org) or the source you want to push to. Or you can 
 explicitly pass the apikey to the command. See [[`apikey`|Commandsapikey]] command help 
 for instructions on saving your key:

    choco apikey -?

A common error is `Failed to process request. 'The specified API key 
 does not provide the authority to push packages.' The remote server 
 returned an error: (403) Forbidden..` This means the package already 
 exists with a different user (API key). The package could be unlisted. 
 You can verify by going to https://push.chocolatey.org/packages/packageName. 
 Please contact the administrators of https://push.chocolatey.org/ if you see this 
 and you don't see a good reason for it.

## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please 
 file a ticket so we can document it at 
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## Options and Switches

**NOTE:** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.
