# Source Command (choco sources)

Chocolatey will allow you to interact with sources.

**NOTE:** Mostly compatible with older chocolatey client (0.9.8.x and
 below) with options and switches. When enabling, disabling or removing
 a source, use `-name` in front of the option now. In most cases you
 can still pass options and switches with one dash (`-`). For more
 details, see [[how to pass arguments|CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches]] (`choco -?`).

## Usage

    choco source [list]|add|remove|disable|enable [<options/switches>]
    choco sources [list]|add|remove|disable|enable [<options/switches>]

## Examples

    choco source
    choco source list
    choco source add -n=bob -s="https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/"
    choco source add -n=bob -s "'https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/'" -cert=\Users\bob\bob.pfx
    choco source add -n=bob -s "'https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/'" -u=bob -p=12345
    choco source disable -n=bob
    choco source enable -n=bob
    choco source remove -n=bob

When it comes to the source location, this can be a folder/file share or an http
location. If it is a url, it will be a location you can go to in a browser and 
it returns OData with something that says Packages in the browser, similar to 
what you see when you go to https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/.

**NOTE:** See scripting in [[how to pass arguments|CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches]] (`choco -?`) for how to 
 write proper scripts and integrations.


## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please 
 file a ticket so we can document it at 
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## Options and Switches

**NOTE:** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.
