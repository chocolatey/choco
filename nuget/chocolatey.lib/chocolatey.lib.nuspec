    <description>
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages from the distros to your door, err computer.

Chocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community, the work and thankless nights of the Chocolatey Team (https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/people), with Rob heading up the direction.

You can host your own sources and add them to Chocolatey, you can extend Chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.

This is the Chocolatey Library (API / DLL) package which allows Chocolatey to be embedded in your application.

## 0.10.8

With this release, Package Parameters are fully supported from both the user side and the packaging side. Check out [the documentation](https://chocolatey.org/docs/helpers-get-packageparameters) and check out the [walkthrough](https://chocolatey.org/docs/how-to-parse-package-parameters-argument) on how to use package parameters in your packaging. Note if you are pushing packages to the community repository, you must continue to take a dependency on the `chocolatey-core.extension` as a polyfill for older versions until at least six months after a new feature is released.

What you can do with logging has greatly increased your ability to have more power over how it works and deeper output to determine errors (we've expanded `--trace` [#1379](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1379)). This release also gives packagers and users more power when working with the AutoUninstaller - opt-out ([#1257](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1257)) and passing arguments to the uninstaller ([#1133](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1133)).

Another noteworthy addition is the ability to pass custom properties to Choco like you would do with `nuget pack`, allowing better integration with packages you manage in Visual Studio ([#1313](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1313)).
