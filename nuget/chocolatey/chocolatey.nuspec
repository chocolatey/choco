    <summary>Chocolatey is your machine level NuGet repository. Think apt-get for Windows (executables/application packages), not library packages.</summary>
    <description>
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages from the distros to your door, err computer.

Chocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community, the work and thankless nights of the [Chocolatey Team](https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/people), with Rob heading up the direction.

You can host your own sources and add them to Chocolatey, you can extend Chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.

### Commands
There are quite a few commands you can call - you should check out the [command reference](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference). Here are the most common:

 * Help - choco -? or choco command -?
 * Search - choco search something
 * List - choco list -lo
 * Config - choco config list
 * Install - choco install baretail
 * Pin - choco pin windirstat
 * Outdated - choco outdated
 * Upgrade - choco upgrade baretail
 * Uninstall - choco uninstall baretail

 Alternative installation sources:
 * Install ruby gem - choco install compass -source ruby
 * Install python egg - choco install sphynx -source python
 * Install windows feature - choco install IIS -source windowsfeatures
 * Install webpi feature - choco install IIS7.5Express -source webpi

For more advanced commands and switches, use `choco -?` or `choco command -h`. You can also look at the [command reference](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference), including how you can force a package to install the x86 version of a package.

### Create Packages?
We have some great guidance on how to do that. Where? I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with sticky! [Wiki!](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CreatePackages)

In that mess there is a link to the [Helper Reference](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/HelpersReference).

    <releaseNotes>
See all - https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/stable/CHANGELOG.md

## 0.9.10

What will be highlighted:

* Alternative sources (webpi, windowsfeature, cygwin, etc) are back (finally, right?)!
* Use an internal PowerShell host to take advantage of quite a few improvements!
* Introduce managing package templates, reintroduce extensions.
* Talk about using original download file name
* Talk about the improvements in search information
* Talk a little about what's coming with pro

### BREAKING CHANGES

 * Only fail automation scripts (chocolateyInstall.ps1) if the script returns non-zero exit code - see [#445](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/445)
 * Fix - Force reinstall, force upgrade, and uninstall should delete the download cache - see [#590](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/590)

For 445 - the 0.9.8 series would only fail a package with terminating errors. The 0.9.9 series took that a bit further and started failing packages if anything wrote to stderr. It turns out that is a bad idea. Only when PowerShell exits with non-zero (which comes with terminating errors) should the package fail due to this. If you need the old behavior of the 0.9.9 series, you can get it back with a switch (`--fail-on-standard-error` and its aliases) and/or a feature flip (`failOnStandardError`).

For 590 - if you set a custom cache directory for downloads, it will no longer use a "chocolatey" subdirectory under that. You may need to make any adjustments if this is going to affect you.
