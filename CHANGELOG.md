## [0.10.12](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.12+is%3Aclosed) - (March 14, 2019)
We are pretty excited to finally share a new Chocolatey release! And this release won't disappoint. Loads of bug fixes, enhanced exit codes for search, list, info and outdated when results are returned versus nothing being returned, and some really nice improvements.

Perhaps the biggest addition this release is the ability to halt installation if a reboot is detected ([#1038](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1038)). Once you turn this feature on, if you are installing some packages and somewhere in the middle of that there is a need for a reboot, Chocolatey will stop and exit with either exit code 350 (pending reboot prior to anything) or 1604 (install incomplete), indicating a reboot is needed to continue. It won't reboot for you, as it is just a package manager - but it will stop execution so nothing that may error on install is attemtped. You'll need to opt into this feature, so see [#1038](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1038) for details.

If you've long hated the default console colors, we've spent quite a bit of time detecting the background console color and adjusting the colorization output of Chocolatey for this release ([#1131](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1131)). You might give that a whirl and see if you can turn back on console colors for good.

We've added the ability to validate the configuration and system state at a global level ([#1746](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1746)). It's early, but expect that we'll do a lot more to really provide good experiences in this area.

A bug that is worth noting as fixed is having choco exit when a source fails instead of ignoring it ([#612](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/612)). This is now fixed!

The last thing worth noting in the summary is Enhanced Exit Codes, or providing more intentional exit codes that mean something instead of just 0 or 1 ([#1758](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1758)). In this release, outdated and search commands will have additional exit codes that mean something. This is noted in the next section, so please read over and see how to shut off this behavior if you see it breaking any integration you might be using (including your own scripts).

### BREAKING CHANGES
 * outdated - Exit 2 when there are packages out of date - see [#1602](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1602)
 * search/list/info - Exit 2 when no results are returned - see [#1724](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1724)

We've listed these as breaking changes as it may affect tools that are integrating with Chocolatey and interpreting the output of the exit code. In these cases, it would likely temporarily break those tools until they've had a chance to release new versions of their tools. If you run into this, you simply need to turn off the feature "useEnhancedExitCodes". That is as simple as `choco feature disable --name="'useEnhancedExitCodes'"` ([#1758](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1758)).

## [0.10.9](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.9+is%3Aclosed) (March 25, 2018)
The vendored 7Zip had a couple of security findings that necessitated a release. There is also a lot of goodness going into this release as well. We've fixed XDT transforms not to keep extra data around (requiring manual fixes). We've resolved some issues surrounding compatibility with Get-PackageParameters in the chocolatey-core.extension package and what's now built into Chocolatey. That should now work appropriately, and the built-in method should be preferred, so if you are using `--package-parameters-sensitive`, those will be added as well when you do have the chocolatey-core.extension package also installed.

We've also brought in the long desired logging with no colorization. You can set that as a switch or globally with a feature flipper. With outdated/upgrade, you can now ignore unfound packages along with already skipping pinned packages. That will help you reduce your output to only the things it finds upgrades for that can be upgraded.

## [0.10.8](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.8+is%3Aclosed) (August 30, 2017)
With this release, Package Parameters are fully supported from both the user side and the packaging side. Check out [the documentation](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/get-packageparameters) and check out the [walkthrough](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/guides/create/parse-packageparameters-argument) on how to use package parameters in your packaging. Note if you are pushing packages to the community repository, you must continue to take a dependency on the `chocolatey-core.extension` as a polyfill for older versions until at least six months after a new feature is released.

What you can do with logging has greatly increased your ability to have more power over how it works and deeper output to determine errors (we've expanded `--trace` [#1379](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1379)). This release also gives packagers and users more power when working with the AutoUninstaller - opt-out ([#1257](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1257)) and passing arguments to the uninstaller ([#1133](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1133)).

Another noteworthy addition is the ability to pass custom properties to Choco like you would do with `nuget pack`, allowing better integration with packages you manage in Visual Studio ([#1313](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1313)).

### FEATURES
 * Function - Get-PackageParameters - see [#1393](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1393)

### BUG FIXES

## [0.10.7](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.7+is%3Aclosed) (June 8, 2017)
### BREAKING CHANGES
 * Set requested execution level back to asInvoker while determining more advanced elevated scenarios - see [#1324](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1324)

   After much deliberation with the community, we're moving execution policy back to the default of `asInvoker` to make it work like it did prior to 0.10.4. However we are leaving it open for you to change it to whatever execution level you want by keeping the manifest external from choco.exe. We will be looking more at advanced scenarios - the discussion is at [#1307](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1307). If you don't have a GitHub account, feel free to start a thread on the mailing list (and if you are a customer, you have private channels to voice your opinions on this change).

   Moving to "asInvoker" means that Chocolatey will not ask for elevated privileges prior to execution, so you will need to remember to do that yourself. If you go to `$env:ChocolateyInstall`, you will find `choco.exe.manifest`, and you have freedom to adjust the execution level as you see fit. There is one catch, you will need to do it on every install/upgrade of Chocolatey until [#1206](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1206) is implemented.

### BUG FIXES
 * Fix - Add file/file64 not as aliases, but use them to set url/url64 if empty - see [#1323](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1323)
 * Fix - Automatic Uninstaller doesn't split multiple paths - see [#1327](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1327)

This release includes fixes and adjustments to the API to make it more usable. Search / List has also been improved with the data that it returns when verbose/detailed, along with info always returning a package with information instead of erroring sometimes. The search results from the community package repository now match what you see on the website.

## [0.10.4](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.4+is%3Aclosed) (March 30, 2017)

We're dubbing this the "10-4 good buddy" release. We've added some major functionality and fixes we think you are going to find top notch - dare we say as smooth as really expensive chocolate? A lot of work for this release has been provided by the community. Remember that Chocolatey is only as good as the support that comes from the community! Be sure to thank other community members for the awesome that is Chocolatey and Chocolatey 10-4. We've closed over 30 bugs and added over 40 enhancements (75 tickets in total)!

Proxy support just got some major enhancements with the ability to not only [specify proxy information at runtime](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1173), but also to [set bypass lists and bypassing on local connections](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1165) and [configure source repositories to bypass proxies](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/262). A major issue with [changing command execution timeout](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1059) was just fixed. And there used to be a tiny chance you might [corrupt the choco config when running multiple choco processes](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1047) -but now that is much better handled.

We've also made [package itself display download progress](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1134), which is great when software binaries are embedded in packages. For you folks looking to remove any progress (like when using Vagrant), now you can use [`--no-progress`](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/917). When NuGet.Core has issues, those issues will have more visibility into why things are failing without needing a debugging log. Speaking of some extreme visibility, see network traffic with [`--trace`](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1182).

We've got a few possible breaking changes that could affect you, see what we've written about them below.

This also marks the first release that uses the [Chocolatey Software digital certificate for signing](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1214) instead of the RealDimensions Software, LLC certificate.

Another major feature released in preview is [using remembered arguments on upgrade](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/797). This is in preview in 0.10.4 and will be turned to 'on' automatically in a future release. We are going to be continually making it better and won't turn it on by default until it is ready. If you want to turn it on and start using it, once you have 0.10.4 installed, run `choco feature enable -n useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`. You can also do this per command with `--use-remembered-arguments`. You can also turn it off per command with `--ignore-remembered-arguments`. We've also really described a lot of important considerations and thoughts related to using this so there are no surprises. Please do read the issue notes at length if you plan to use this feature to reduce confusion.

### BREAKING CHANGES
 * Run with highestAvailable Execution Level by default - see [#1054](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1054)

   One longstanding request with Chocolatey was to have it always request admin privileges before running. This has been a hope that it would cut down on the accidental runs of Chocolatey in a command shell that is not elevated and needing to open one that is elevated. This UAC (User account control) setting is handled by something called an application manifest (app.manifest). We had it set to "asInvoker", or run with the context of the user that ran the command. We've moved this to "highestAvailable", which means if you are a non-admin, it will just run under your context, but if you are an admin in a non-elevated shell, it will ask for elevated permissions to run. There is also "requireAdministrator", which locks execution down to administrators only.

   Moving to "highestAvailable" allows for that asking of privileges that you are used to, up front before it runs. However one additional thing we did here was give you more control over this setting now. We used to embed the app manifest into choco.exe. We now set it next to choco.exe (base install under `$env:ChocolateyInstall`, you will find `choco.exe.manifest`) so you have more freedom to adjust those execution levels as you see fit. There is one catch, you will need to do it on every install/upgrade of Chocolatey until [#1206](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1206) is implemented.

 * When a prerelease is installed, it should upgrade to latest prerelease unless excluded - typically seen in choco upgrade all - see [#686](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/686)

   When you run `choco upgrade all`, it never catches the prereleases. However if you run `choco upgrade all --pre`, it may upgrade some of your stable installs to prereleases. Neither of these situations are desirable. So by default, we've made it so that `choco upgrade all` just does the right thing, which is to upgrade your stable releases to the latest stable release and your prerelease packages will upgrade to the absolute latest available, whether that be stable or prerelease. If you need to change the behavior back to the old way for upgrade all, simply add the `--exclude-prerelease` option.

 * Fix - Passing Allow Downgrade To upgrade against a prerelease may downgrade it to last stable version - see [#1212](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1212)

   This is a bug fix that was allowing a prerelease to be downgraded accidentally to the last stable version if you ran `choco upgrade somepackage --allow-downgrade` without a particular version and without `--pre`. Now while this would be less affected with #686 above, it could still happen. It's a bug. The only reason this was marked as breaking change is that someone could be depending on the buggy behavior. So heads up, this bug is now fixed. If you are attempting to downgrade, make sure you specify the version you want it to go down to.

## [0.10.3](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.3+is%3Aclosed) (October 7, 2016)
### BREAKING CHANGES
 * Fix - Do Not Check `$LastExitCode` - Only error a package install if script errors or set a different exit code when it is specifically set - see [#1000](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1000)

   Starting in v0.9.10, Chocolatey started checking `$LASTEXITCODE` in addition to the script command success as a way to be more helpful in determining package failures. This meant it offered the ability to capture when a script exited with `Exit 1` and handle that accordingly. However that really has never been a recommended scenario for returning errors from scripts and is not seen in the wild anywhere so it is believed that those that may be affected are very few.

   Checking `$LastExitCode` checks the last executable's exit code when the script specifically does not call `Exit` (which is . This can lead to very perplexing failures, such as running a successful xcopy that exits with `2` and seeing package failures without understanding why. Since it is not typically recommended to call `Exit` to return a value from PowerShell because of issues with different hosts, it's less of a concern to only look at explicit failures. For folks that may need it, allow failing a package again by the last external command exit code or `exit` from a PowerShell script. Note that it is not recommended to use exit with a number to return from PowerShell scripts. Instead you should use `$env:ChocolateyExitCode` or `Set-PowerShellExitCode` (first available in v0.9.10) to ensure proper setting of the exit code.

   If you need the prior behavior, please turn on the feature `scriptsCheckLastExitCode`.

### BUG FIXES
 * Fix - chocolateybeforemodify runs after modifying (moving) chocolatey lib package files - see [#995](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/995)
 * Fix - The refreshenv command throws an error about Write-FunctionCallLogMessage when ran in PowerShell on 0.10.2 - see [#996](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/996)


## [0.10.2](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.2+is%3Aclosed) (September 30, 2016)
We're dubbing this the "Every Joe" release in honor of a friend that just lost his fight with brain cancer. If you want to help further research, please make a donation to a cancer research association of your choosing (e.g. the [American Brain Tumor Assocation](http://www.abta.org/thank-you.html)).

A couple of important fixes/enhancements in this release. Most of the improvements are about providing better feedback to you and fixing minor issues. The big one surrounds when packages set a download path for a file using `$env:TEMP`, choco will ensure that the file can still be found for later use.

### BUG FIXES
 * Fix - Downloaded file is at old `$env:TEMP\chocolatey\chocolatey` location, but install calls with just `$env:TEMP\chocolatey\` location - see [#969](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/969)
 * Fix - [Pro/Business] UseOriginalLocation fails when there is no 64bit file - see [#972](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/972)
 * Fix - Do not use unparsed options as package names - see [#983](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/983)

### IMPROVEMENTS
 * Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin enhancements - see [#977](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/977)
 * Log PowerShell function calls better - see [#976](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/976)
 * Allow environment variables in some config settings - see [#971](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/971)
 * [Pro/Business] Provide license type to environment variables - see [#968](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/968)

 * Remove extra forward slashes in url - see [#986](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/986)
 * Side by side uninstall enhancements - see [#992](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/992)


## [0.10.1](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.1+is%3Aclosed) (September 19, 2016)
We're dubbing this the "Shhh! Keep that secret please" release. We've found that when passing in passwords and other sensitive arguments, those items can end up in the logs in clear text. We've addressed this in [#948](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/948) and [#953](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/953). When it comes to passing sensitive arguments through to native installers, you can set up environment variables with those sensitive args and pass those arguments directly through to `Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin`. If you prefer a better experience, the licensed version allows passing sensitive options directly through choco.exe as `--install-arguments-sensitive` and `--package-parameters-sensitive`. Read more in the [Licensed CHANGELOG](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/blob/master/CHANGELOG_LICENSED.md).

Perhaps the biggest improvement in this release is that Chocolatey will automatically look to see if it can download binaries over HTTPS when provided an HTTP url. If so, Chocolatey will switch to downloading the binaries over SSL. This provides better security in downloading and knowing you are getting the binary from the source location instead of a possible man in the middle location, especially when the package does not provide checksums for verification.

Another improvement you may not even notice, but we think you will love is that Chocolatey now supports TLS v1.2 transport which presents a nice transparent increase in security. You will need to have at least .NET Framework 4.5 installed to take advantage of this feature.

### FEATURES
 * [Security] Support TLS v1.2 - see [#458](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/458)
 * [Security] Attempt to download packages via HTTPS connection - see [#746](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/746)
 * [Security] Pro/Business - Pass sensitive arguments to installers - see [#948](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/948)
 * Search (and info) by version - see [#935](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/935)

### BUG FIXES

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.0+is%3Aclosed) (August 11, 2016)
What was planned for 0.9.10.4 is now 0.10.0. This is due partly to a breaking change we are making for security purposes and a move to provide better a better versioning scheme for the remainder of the sub-v1 versions of Chocolatey. Instead of 0.y.z.0 being considered where major verions occur in the sub 1 series, 0.y.0 will now be considered where those major versions occur. We also are moving right along towards v1 (and hope to be there in 2017).

0.10.0 carries the fixes for 0.9.10.4 and includes a major security enhancement (checksum requirement).

### BREAKING CHANGES
 * [Security] Checksum requirement and enhancements - see [#112](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/112)

Checksums in package scripts are meant as a measure to validate the originally intended downloaded resources used in the creation of a package are the same files that are received at a future date. This also ensures that the same files that are checked by all parts of moderation (if applicable) are the same files that are received by users for a package. This is seen mostly on the community repository because it is public and packages are subject to copyright laws (distribution rights), which typically requires the package scripts to download software from the official distribution locations. The Chocolatey framework has had the ability to use checksums in package scripts since [July 2014](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey/0.9.8.24#releasenotes).

**What is the requirement?** choco will now fail if a package download resources from HTTP/FTP and does not use checksums to verify those downloaded resources. The requirement for HTTP/FTP is [#112](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/112). We are considering also requiring it for [HTTPS (#895)](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/895) as well. You can optionally set a feature (`allowEmptyChecksumsSecure`) to ensure packages using HTTPS also use checksums.

**How does this protect the community anymore than before?** During moderation review, there is a check of these downloaded binaries against VirusTotal (which verifies these binaries against 50-60+ different virus scanners). The binaries are also verified for installation purposes against a test computer. With an independent 3rd party checksum in the package itself, it guarantees that the files received by a user from those remote sources are the exact same files that were used in the verification process.

**Why the requirement, and why now?** This is a measure of protection for the Chocolatey community. HTTP is easy to hack with both DNS poisoning and MITM (man in the middle) attacks. Without independent verification of the integrity of the downloaded resources, users can be left susceptible to these issues. We've been planning a move to require checksums for awhile now, with a planned longer and smoother transition for package maintainers to get packages updated to reduce breakages. Unfortunately there was a recent event with [FOSSHub getting hacked](http://www.audacityteam.org/compromised-download-partner/) (the [community repository had 8 possibly affected packages](http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/?u=86a6d80146a0da7f2223712e4&id=f2fe8dbe6b) and [we quickly took action](http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/?u=86a6d80146a0da7f2223712e4&id=2cbe87d486)), which necessitated a need for us to move in a much swifter fashion to ensure the protection of the community sooner, rather than later. The changes in Chocolatey represented by the checksum changes are a major step in the process to ensure protection. Requiring for HTTPS as well will mitigate any future compromises of software distribution sites that are used with Chocolatey packages.

**Can I shut this behavior off or opt out per package?**
You can shut off the checksum requirement by enabling the feature `allowEmptyChecksums`. This will return Chocolatey to previous behavior. We strongly recommend against it.

You can shut it off or turn it per package install/upgrade with `--allow-empty-checksums` and `--require-checksums`, respectively. See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/install / https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/upgrade.

You can also disable the feature `allowEmptyChecksumsSecure` to enforce checksums for packages that download from secure locations (HTTPS).

**Other things I should know?** Users also now have the ability to pass their own checksums and checksumtypes into the install. See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/install / https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/upgrade.

The "I got 99 problems, but a package manager ain't one" release. With the release of 0.9.10 (or if you prefer 0.9.10.0), we're about to make everything 100% better in your Windows package management world. We've addressed over 100 features and bugs in this release. We looked at how we could improve PowerShell and we've come out with a [competely internal host](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/8) that can Prompt and Read-Host in a way that times out and selects default values after a period of time. Speaking of PowerShell, how about some tab completion `choco &lt;tab&gt;` to `choco install node&lt;tab&gt;`? How about never having to [close and reopen your shell again](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/664)?

Alternative sources (`-source webpi`, `-s windowsfeature`, etc) are back! I mean, am I right?! Have you heard of auto uninstaller? If Chocolatey has installed something that works with Programs and Features, Chocolatey knows how to uninstall it without an uninstall script about 90+% of the time. This feature was in beta for the 0.9.9 series, it is on by default in 0.9.10 (unless you disabled it after trying it, you will need to reenable it, see `choco feature` for more details).

Here's one you probably never knew existed - extensions. Chocolatey has had the ability to extend itself by adding PowerShell modules for years, and most folks either didn't know it existed or have never used them. We've enhanced them a bit in preparation for the licensed version of Chocolatey.

We redesigned our `choco new` default packaging template and we've made managing templates as easy as managing packages.

`choco search`/`choco list` has so many enhancements, you may not need to visit dot org again. [See it in action](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/list#see-it-in-action).
* [search -v provides moderation related information and a world of nuspec information](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/493)
* [search by id only](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/663)
* [search by id exact](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/453)
* [search by approved only, not broken, and/or by download cache](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/670)
* [sort by version](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/668)
* [search with paging](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/427)

There are 150 tickets closed for this release! We've included remediation steps for when a breaking change affects you. Mostly if you have been using Chocolatey in a recommended way, you won't even notice any adverse changes. There are a number of things we thought to highlight, and quite a few security enhancements coming in this release (look for the [Security] tag on the ticket summary).

### BREAKING CHANGES
 * Only fail automation scripts (chocolateyInstall.ps1) if the script returns non-zero exit code - see [#445](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/445)

The 0.9.8 series would only fail a package with terminating errors. The 0.9.9 series took that a bit further and started failing packages if anything wrote to stderr. It turns out that is a bad idea. Only when PowerShell exits with non-zero (which comes with terminating errors) should the package fail due to this. If you need the old behavior of the 0.9.9 series, you can get it back with a switch (`--fail-on-standard-error` and its aliases) and/or a feature flip (`failOnStandardError`).

 * Fix - Force reinstall, force upgrade, and uninstall should delete the download cache - see [#590](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/590)

If you set a custom cache directory for downloads, it will no longer use a "chocolatey" subdirectory under that. You may need to make any adjustments if this is going to affect you.

 * Exit with the same exit code as the software being installed - see [#512](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/512)

There are more exit codes from Chocolatey now that indicate success -`0`, `1605`, `1614`, `1641`, and `3010`. You may need to adjust anything you were using that would only check for 0 and nonzero.
If you need the previous behavior, be sure to disable the feature `usePackageExitCodes` or use the `--ignore-package-exit-codes` switch in your choco commands.

 * PowerShell module functions adjusted for automatic documentation - see [#697](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/697)

If you were using any of the functions in a non-recommended way or not compliant with the examples, you are going to find breakages in the functions as some of the things that were called out as non-optional are now enforced. This shouldn't affect most folks.

 * [Security] Explicit permissions - remove inheritance/lock down to admins - see [#398](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/398)

This further restricts the default installation location by removing all permissions and inheritance of permissions, explicitly giving Administrator/LocalSystem to Full access, and Users are granted Read and Execute. In prior installations, we ensured Modify access to the installing user, but that has been removed for security reasons. Should you need the previous behavior, set `$env:ChocolateyInstallAllowCurrentUser="true"`.

## [0.9.9.9](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.9.9+is%3Aclosed) (October 2, 2015)

With this release you can completely configure choco from the command line (including the priority of sources). Choco now allows you to create [custom package templates](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/76). Choco has [proper proxy support](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/243) now. We also squashed up some bugs, like the infinite download loop that happens if the connection is lost. We've also improved the installation experience of Chocolatey itself, [unpacking all of the required setup files in the chocolatey package](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/347) and improving the messaging output during the bootstrapping process. Chocolatey also [doesn't try to write config updates every command](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/364), unless something actually changes in the config file. And last but not least for mentions, the issue of [choco not recognizing itself as needing upgraded after being installed by the bootstrapper](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/414) is now fixed.

"Fix Everything. Fix All The Things" - There have been some things bugging us for a long time related to limitations with NuGet, so we decided to fix that. Like [nuspec enhancements](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/205), that crazy [content folder restriction](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/290) has been removed (I know, right?!), and we're working around [badly](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/316) [behaved](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/326) packages quite a bit more to bring you more feature parity.

Let's talk about a couple of big, like really big, BIG features just added with this release. No more packages rebooting Windows. We fixed ([#304](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/304) / [#323](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/323)) and [enhanced](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/305) up the Auto Uninstaller Service quite a bit to ensure things are working like you would expect (It goes on by default in 0.9.10 - we'll start documenting more about it soon). But wait, there's more! I haven't even told you about the big features yet

The first big feature is enhancing the nuspec. I mentioned this I know, but *now* you can use `packageSourceUrl` in the nuspec to tell folks where you are storing the source for the package! We also added `projectSourceUrl`, `docsUrl`, `mailingListUrl`, and `bugTrackerUrl`. What's even better is that the community feed has already been enhanced to look for these values. So have the templates from `choco new`. And it's backwards compatible, meaning you can still install packages that have these added nuspec enhancements without issue (but we will need to provide a fix for Nuget Package Explorer).

The second is Xml Document Transformations (XDT), which I think many folks are aware of but may not realize what it can provide. [NuGet has allowed transformations for quite awhile](https://docs.nuget.org/Create/Configuration-File-and-Source-Code-Transformations) to allow you to make changes to an `app.config`/`web.config` on install/uninstall. We are following in similar footsteps to allow you to do similar when installing/upgrading packages. We will look for `*.install.xdt` files in the package (doesn't matter where) and they will apply to configuration files with the same name in the package. This means that during upgrades we won't overwrite configuration files during upgrades that have opted into this feature. It allows you to give users a better experience during upgrades because they won't need to keep making the same changes to the xml config files each time they upgrade your package.

### FEATURES
 * Allow XDT Configuration Transforms - see [#331](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/331)
 * Prevent reboots - see [#316](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/316)
 * Enhance the nuspec - first wave - see [#205](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/205)

### BUG FIXES
 * When uninstall fails, do not continue removing files - see [#315](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/315)
 * Do not run autouninstaller if the package result is already a failure - see [#323](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/323)
 * Fix - Auto Uninstaller can fail if chocolateyUninstall.ps1 uninstalls prior to it running - see [#304](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/304)
 * Fix - Packages with content folders cannot have a dependency without also having a content folder - see [#290](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/290)
 * Remove ShimGen director files on upgrade/uninstall - see [#326](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/326)

 * Fix - The operation completed successfully on stderr - see [#249](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/249)
 * Fix - When specific nuget version is needed by a package it is the chocolatey version that is used - see [#194](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/194)
 * When installing with *.nupkg, need to get package name from package, not file name - see [#90](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/90)
 * Fix - Choco pin list is not returning a list - see [#302](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/302)
 * Fix - A pin is not created for existing installations (prior to new choco) - see [#60](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/60)

## [0.9.9.6](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.9.6+is%3Aclosed) (May 16, 2015)

Some really large fixes this release, especially removing all files that are installed to the package directory if they haven't changed, including ensuring that the nupkg file is always removed on successful uninstalls. The really big add some folks are going to like is the new outdated command. Some more variables that were misused have been brought back, which allows some packages (like Atom) to be installed again without issue. If you can believe some people never read these, we decided to add a note to the installer prompt to let people know about -y.

## [0.9.9](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.9+is%3Aclosed) (March 3, 2015)

This also includes issues that were being tracked in the old Chocolatey repository: [Chocolatey 0.9.9](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Av0.9.9).

The two links above will not capture everything that has changed, since this is a complete rewrite. We broke everything. If this were a v1+, it would be a major release. But we are less than v1, so 0.9.9 it is! ;)

Okay, so we didn't really break everything. We have maintained nearly full compatibility with how you pass options into choco, although the output may be a bit different (but better, we hope) and in at least one case, additional switches (or a feature setting) is/are required - we limited this to security related changes only.

We also fixed and improved a bunch of things, so we feel the trade off is well worth the changes.

We'll try to capture everything here that you should know about. Please call `choco -?` or `choco.exe -h` to get started.

### KNOWN ISSUES
 * [Known Issues](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/labels/Bug)
 * TEMPORARY `install all` is missing - this is expected to be back in 0.9.10 - see [#23](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/23)
 * Alternative sources (`webpi`,`ruby`,`python`,`cygwin`, `windowsfeature`) do not work yet. This is expected to be fixed in 0.9.10 - see [#14](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/14)
 * Progress bar is missing when downloading until we are using internal posh components for Packages - see [#56](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/56)
 * See [Feature Parity](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/labels/FeatureParity) for items not yet reimplemented from older PowerShell Chocolatey client (v0.9.8.32 and below).

### BREAKING CHANGES
 * [Security] **Prompt for confirmation**: For security reasons, we now stop for confirmation before changing the state of the system on most commands. You can pass `-y` to confirm any prompts or set a value in the config that will globally confirm - see [#52](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/52) (**NOTE**: This is one of those additional switches we were talking about)
 * [Security] If your default installation is still at `c:\Chocolatey`, this version will force a move to ProgramData and update the environment settings - see [#7](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/7)
 * **Configuration Breaking Changes:**
   1. You now have one config file to interact with in %ChocolateyInstall%\config - your user config is no longer valid and can be removed once you migrate settings to the config.
   2. The config will no longer be overwritten on upgrade.
   3. Choco no longer interacts with NuGet's config file at all. You will need to reset all of your apiKeys (see features for `apikey`). On the plus side, the keys will work for all users of the machine, unlike NuGet's apiKeys (only work for the user that sets them).
   4. This also means you can no longer use `useNugetForSources`. It has been removed as a config setting.
 * **Packaging Changes:**
   1. Choco now installs packages without version numbers on folders. This means quite a few things...
   2. Upgrading packages doesn't install a new version next to an old version, it actually upgrades.
   3. Dependencies resolve at highest available version, not the minimum version as before - see [Chocolatey #415](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/415)
 * **Package Maintenance Changes**:
   1. Read the above about apikey changes
   2. Read above about dependency resolution changes.
 * **Deprecated/Removed Commands:**
   1. `installmissing` and 'cinstm' have been removed. They were deprecated awhile ago, so this should not be a surprise. For equivalent functionality see the plain install/cinst commands.
   2. `choco version` has been deprecated and will be removed in v1. Use `choco upgrade pkgName --noop` or `choco upgrade pkgName -whatif` instead.
   3. `Write-ChocolateySuccess`, `Write-ChocolateyFailure` have been deprecated.
   4. `update` is now `upgrade`. `update` has been deprecated and will be removed/replaced in v1. Update will be reincarnated later for a different purpose. **Hint**: It rhymes with smackage pindexes.

### FEATURES
 * In app documentation! Use `choco -?`, `choco -h` or `choco commandName -?` to learn about each command, complete with examples!
 * WhatIf/Noop mode for all commands (`--noop` can also be specified as `-whatif`) - see [Chocolatey #263](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/263) and [Default Options and Switches](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands#how-to-pass-options-switches)
 * Performs like a package manager, expect to see queries failing because of unmet dependency issues.
 * **New Commands:**
   1. `pin` - Suppress upgrades. This allows you to 'pin' an install to a particular version - see [#1](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1), [Chocolatey #5](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/5) and [Pin Command](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/pin)
   2. `apikey` - see [ApiKey Command](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/commands/api-key)
   3. `new` - see [New Command](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/commands/new) and [Chocolatey #157](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/157)
 * New ways to pass arguments! See [How to Pass Options/Switches](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands#how-to-pass-options-switches)
 * Did we mention there is a help menu that is actually helpful now? Shiny!
 * AutoUninstaller!!!! But it is not enabled by default this version. See [#15](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/15), [#9](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/9) and [Chocolatey #6](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/6)
 * **New Helpers:**
   1. `Install-ChocolateyShortcut` - see [Chocolatey #238](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/238), [Chocolatey #235](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/235) and [Chocolatey #218](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/218)
