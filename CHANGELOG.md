## [0.9.10](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.10+is%3Aclosed) (unreleased)

The "I got 99 problems, but a package manager ain't one" release. With the release of 0.9.10 (or if you prefer 0.9.10.0), we're about to make everything 100% better in your Windows package management world. We've addressed over 100 features and bugs in this release. We looked at how we could improve PowerShell and we've come out with a [competely internal host](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/8) that can Prompt and Read-Host in a way that times out and selects default values after a period of time. Speaking of PowerShell, how about some tab completion `choco &lt;tab&gt;` to `choco install node&lt;tab&gt;`? How about never having to [close and reopen your shell again](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/664)?

Alternative sources (`-source webpi`, `-s windowsfeature`, etc) are back! I mean, am I right?! Have you heard of auto uninstaller? If Chocolatey has installed something that works with Programs and Features, Chocolatey knows how to uninstall it without an uninstall script about 90+% of the time. This feature was in beta for the 0.9.9 series, it is on by default in 0.9.10 (unless you disabled it after trying it, you will need to reenable it, see `choco feature` for more details).

Here's one you probably never knew existed - extensions. Chocolatey has had the ability to extend itself by adding PowerShell modules for years, and most folks either didn't know it existed or have never used them. We've enhanced them a bit in preparation for the licensed version of Chocolatey.

We redesigned our `choco new` default packaging template and we've made managing templates as easy as managing packages.

`choco search`/`choco list` has so many enhancements, you may not need to visit dot org again. [See it in action](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsList#see-it-in-action).
* [search -v provides moderation related information and a world of nuspec information](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/493)
* [search by id only](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/663)
* [search by id exact](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/453)
* [search by approved only, not broken, and/or by download cache](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/670)
* [sort by version](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/668)
* [search with paging](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/427)

What will be highlighted:

* Introduce managing package templates, reintroduce extensions.
* Talk a little about what's coming with pro

### BREAKING CHANGES

 * Only fail automation scripts (chocolateyInstall.ps1) if the script returns non-zero exit code - see [#445](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/445)

The 0.9.8 series would only fail a package with terminating errors. The 0.9.9 series took that a bit further and started failing packages if anything wrote to stderr. It turns out that is a bad idea. Only when PowerShell exits with non-zero (which comes with terminating errors) should the package fail due to this. If you need the old behavior of the 0.9.9 series, you can get it back with a switch (`--fail-on-standard-error` and its aliases) and/or a feature flip (`failOnStandardError`).

 * Fix - Force reinstall, force upgrade, and uninstall should delete the download cache - see [#590](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/590)

If you set a custom cache directory for downloads, it will no longer use a "chocolatey" subdirectory under that. You may need to make any adjustments if this is going to affect you.

 * Exit with the same exit code as the software being installed - see [#512](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/512)

There are more exit codes from Chocolatey now that indicate success -`0`, `1605`, `1614`, `1641`, and `3010`. You may need to adjust anything you were using that would only check for 0 and nonzero.
If you need the previous behavior, be sure to disable the feature `usePackageExitCodes` or use the `--ignore-package-exit-codes` switch in your choco commands.

## [0.9.9.9](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.9.9+is%3Aclosed) (October 2, 2015)

With this release you can completely configure choco from the command line (including the priority of sources). Choco now allows you to create [custom package templates](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/76). Choco has [proper proxy support](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/243) now. We also squashed up some bugs, like the infinite download loop that happens if the connection is lost. We've also improved the installation experience of Chocolatey itself, [unpacking all of the required setup files in the chocolatey package](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/347) and improving the messaging output during the bootstrapping process. Chocolatey also [doesn't try to write config updates every command](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/364), unless something actually changes in the config file. And last but not least for mentions, the issue of [choco not recognizing itself as needing upgraded after being installed by the bootstrapper](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/414) is now fixed.

"Fix Everything. Fix All The Things" - There have been some things bugging us for a long time related to limitations with NuGet, so we decided to fix that. Like [nuspec enhancements](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/205), that crazy [content folder restriction](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/290) has been removed (I know, right?!), and we're working around [badly](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/316) [behaved](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/326) packages quite a bit more to bring you more feature parity.

Let's talk about a couple of big, like really big, BIG features just added with this release. No more packages rebooting Windows. We fixed ([#304](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/304) / [#323](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/323)) and [enhanced](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/305) up the Auto Uninstaller Service quite a bit to ensure things are working like you would expect (It goes on by default in 0.9.10 - we'll start documenting more about it soon). But wait, there's more! I haven't even told you about the big features yet

The first big feature is enhancing the nuspec. I mentioned this I know, but *now* you can use `packageSourceUrl` in the nuspec to tell folks where you are storing the source for the package! We also added `projectSourceUrl`, `docsUrl`, `mailingListUrl`, and `bugTrackerUrl`. What's even better is that the community feed has already been enhanced to look for these values. So have the templates from `choco new`. And it's backwards compatible, meaning you can still install packages that have these added nuspec enhancements without issue (but we will need to provide a fix for Nuget Package Explorer).

The second is Xml Document Transformations (XDT), which I think many folks are aware of but may not realize what it can provide. [NuGet has allowed transformations for quite awhile](https://docs.nuget.org/Create/Configuration-File-and-Source-Code-Transformations) to allow you to make changes to an `app.config`/`web.config` on install/uninstall. We are following in similar footsteps to allow you to do similar when installing/upgrading packages. We will look for `*.install.xdt` files in the package (doesn't matter where) and they will apply to configuration files with the same name in the package. This means that during upgrades we won't overwrite configuration files during upgrades that have opted into this feature. It allows you to give users a better experience during upgrades because they won't need to keep making the same changes to the xml config files each time they upgrade your package.

### FEATURES

 * Allow XDT Configuration Transforms - see [#331](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/331)
 * Prevent reboots - see [#316](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/316)

## [0.9.9.6](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.9.6+is%3Aclosed) (May 16, 2015)

Some really large fixes this release, especially removing all files that are installed to the package directory if they haven't changed, including ensuring that the nupkg file is always removed on successful uninstalls. The really big add some folks are going to like is the new outdated command. Some more variables that were misused have been brought back, which allows some packages (like Atom) to be installed again without issue. If you can believe some people never read these, we decided to add a note to the installer prompt to let people know about -y.

## [0.9.9](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.9+is%3Aclosed) (March 3, 2015)

This also includes issues that were being tracked in the old Chocolatey repository: [Chocolatey 0.9.9](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Av0.9.9).

The two links above will not capture everything that has changed, since this is a complete rewrite. We broke everything. If this were a v1+, it would be a major release. But we are less than v1, so 0.9.9 it is! ;)

Okay, so we didn't really break everything. We have maintained nearly full compatibility with how you pass options into choco, although the output may be a bit different (but better, we hope) and in at least one case, additional switches (or a feature setting) is/are required - we limited this to security related changes only.

We also fixed and improved a bunch of things, so we feel the trade off is well worth the changes.

We'll try to capture everything here that you should know about. Please call `choco -?` or `choco.exe -h` to get started.

### KNOWN ISSUES

 * [Known Issues](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/labels/Bug)
 * TEMPORARY `install all` is missing - this is expected to be back in 0.9.10 - see [#23](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/23)
 * Alternative sources (`webpi`,`ruby`,`python`,`cygwin`, `windowsfeature`) do not work yet. This is expected to be fixed in 0.9.10 - see [#14](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/14)
 * Progress bar is missing when downloading until we are using internal posh components for Packages - see [#56](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/56)
 * See [Feature Parity](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/labels/FeatureParity) for items not yet reimplemented from older PowerShell Chocolatey client (v0.9.8.32 and below).

### BREAKING CHANGES

 * [Security] **Prompt for confirmation**: For security reasons, we now stop for confirmation before changing the state of the system on most commands. You can pass `-y` to confirm any prompts or set a value in the config that will globally confirm - see [#52](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/52) (**NOTE**: This is one of those additional switches we were talking about)
 * [Security] If your default installation is still at `c:\Chocolatey`, this version will force a move to ProgramData and update the environment settings - see [#7](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/7)
 * **Configuration Breaking Changes:**
   1. You now have one config file to interact with in %ChocolateyInstall%\config - your user config is no longer valid and can be removed once you migrate settings to the config.
   2. The config will no longer be overwritten on upgrade.
   3. Choco no longer interacts with NuGet's config file at all. You will need to reset all of your apiKeys (see features for `apikey`). On the plus side, the keys will work for all users of the machine, unlike NuGet's apiKeys (only work for the user that sets them).
   4. This also means you can no longer use `useNugetForSources`. It has been removed as a config setting.
 * **Packaging Changes:**
   1. Choco now installs packages without version numbers on folders. This means quite a few things...
   2. Upgrading packages doesn't install a new version next to an old version, it actually upgrades.
   3. Dependencies resolve at highest available version, not the minimum version as before - see [Chocolatey #415](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/415)
 * **Package Maintenance Changes**:
   1. Read the above about apikey changes
   2. Read above about dependency resolution changes.
 * **Deprecated/Removed Commands:**
   1. `installmissing` has been removed. It was deprecated awhile ago, so this should not be a surprise.
   2. `choco version` has been deprecated and will be removed in v1. Use `choco upgrade pkgName --noop` or `choco upgrade pkgName -whatif` instead.
   3. `Write-ChocolateySuccess`, `Write-ChocolateyFailure` have been deprecated.
   4. `update` is now `upgrade`. `update` has been deprecated and will be removed/replaced in v1. Update will be reincarnated later for a different purpose. **Hint**: It rhymes with smackage pindexes.

### FEATURES

 * In app documentation! Use `choco -?`, `choco -h` or `choco commandName -?` to learn about each command, complete with examples!
 * WhatIf/Noop mode for all commands (`--noop` can also be specified as `-whatif`) - see [Chocolatey #263](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/263) and [Default Options and Switches](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference#default-options-and-switches)
 * Performs like a package manager, expect to see queries failing because of unmet dependency issues.
 * **New Commands:**
   1. `pin` - Suppress upgrades. This allows you to 'pin' an install to a particular version - see [#1](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1), [Chocolatey #5](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/5) and [Pin Command](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsPin)
   2. `apikey` - see [ApiKey Command](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsApiKey)
   3. `new` - see [New Command](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsNew) and [Chocolatey #157](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/157)
 * New ways to pass arguments! See [How to Pass Options/Switches](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CommandsReference#how-to-pass-options--switches)
 * Did we mention there is a help menu that is actually helpful now? Shiny!
 * AutoUninstaller!!!! But it is not enabled by default this version. See [#15](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/15), [#9](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/9) and [Chocolatey #6](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/6)
 * **New Helpers:**
   1. `Install-ChocolateyShortcut` - see [Chocolatey #238](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/238), [Chocolatey #235](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/235) and [Chocolatey #218](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/issues/218)
