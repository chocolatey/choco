## 1.8.0 (November 16, 2016)

Package Builder has some major improvements in this release, including a new UI! See https://chocolatey.org/blog/package-builder-announcements for details! While building some of the features for the enhancements for this release, we've made quite a few tweaks and fixes to Package Builder and we think you are going to like the results. Being able to generate packages from the installed software on a reference system is huge (`choco new --from-programs-and-features`)!

Pro users now have the ability to download packages (minus internalization). This is fantastic if you want to pull down a lot of packages quickly from a remote source. Or pull down packages and push them up to an internal source.

### FEATURES

 * Package Downloader comes to Pro+ Licenses - minus internalizer, you can now download a package using an easy command `choco download`.
 * Package Builder (Choco New):
    * Package Builder now has a UI - see https://youtu.be/qJNKR_PEQqY for details.
    * Right click on an exe, msi, zip (or other supported types) and click "Create Package..."
    * Package Builder - generate packages from installed software (Programs and Features) - see https://youtu.be/Mw_ReipnskI for details.

### BUG FIXES

 * Package Builder (Choco New):
    * Fix - silent arguments for MSU/MSP should not include the file itself.
    * Fix - remove comma if found.
    * Fix - remove trailing period.
    * Fix - Remove the entire word surrounding a version.
 * Package Internalizer (Choco Download):
    * Fix - mixed line endings were causing "Index was outside the bounds of the array" errors.
 * Package Synchronizer:
    * Fix - sync location should not be in the extensions folder, causes extension loading issues - a similar fix will be in open source to ignore the old sync location in v0.10.4 (see [#1041](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1041)).
    * Fix - sync over an existing synced package without error.

### IMPROVEMENTS

 * Uninstall - Uninstall software not managed with Chocolatey. Use something like `choco uninstall 7-zip* --from-programs-and-features` to ensure removal from Programs and Features directly. Also requires Chocolatey v0.10.4.
 * VirusTotal - When a user cancels a virus check, set the proper exit code so that rollback occurs automatically - see [#985](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/985).
 * Package Builder (Choco New):
    * Return a TODO list when there are more things to do to finish packaging.
    * Set values to replace if they are not set.
    * Use company name for nuspec copyright if copyright is not available.
    * Provide more verbose logging when necessary.
    * Remove more installer wording - "setup", "remove only".
    * If we exhaust all other options for determining name and version, use the file name and split version from name.
    * Add or remove architecture from the package id - `choco new --include-architecture-in-name` and `choco new --remove-architecture-from-name`, respectively.
 * Package Synchronizer:
    * Synchronize to a new location per package version.


## 1.7.0 (Sep 22, 2016)

### BUG FIXES

 * Package Builder (Choco New) - Removed `fileFullPath` from install template - add back in when local zip only. Fixes an error as `file` and `fileFullPath` are aliases starting in 0.10.1.
 * Package Internalizer (Choco Download) - ensure logging does not incur log format exceptions
 * install/upgrade - Look for downloaded file at old path if replaced 'chocolatey\chocolatey' path does not exist - see [#969](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/969)

### IMPROVEMENTS

 * Package Builder (Choco New):
    * `--build-package` to build a package after Package Builder creates the package all in one go.
    * `--pause-on-error` to pause the output when there are errors for closer inspection (useful when run from a batch file).
    * Specify checksum and type - checksum will be verified against files/downloaded files.
    * Loads of improvements in how package id and title are determined and cleaned up.
    * Product versions and portions of product versions are removed from package id/title.
 * Package Internalizer (Choco Download):
    * Add `--internalize` as alias to `--recompile`.
    * Warn of issue with `-UseOriginalLocation` when only using one file.
    * Add `--append-useoriginallocation` and feature internalizeAppendUseOriginalLocation that makes the determination to add to the end of `Install-ChocolateyPackage` when using local resources.

## 1.6.2 (Sep 19, 2016 - pulled)

### BUG FIXES

 * Recompiled to work with 0.10.1. There were some internal changes that appear to affect the virus scanner and PackageBuilder.

 * Install/upgrade - support MSP (patch files)
 * PackageBuilder - support MSU/MSP files


## 1.6.1 (Sep 8, 2016)

### BUG FIXES

 * Package Builder (Choco New):
    * Fix - Do not error on missing appsearch table in MSI.

## 1.6.0 (Sep 8, 2016)

Some really big improvements are now available in v1.6.0. We are excited to share them with you!

### FEATURES

 * Package Builder (Choco New):
    * Fix - remove parentheses from package names
    * Fix - keep template updated
 * Package Internalizer (Choco Download):
    * Fix - handle downloaded files with the same name Sometimes the file name is the same when the architecture is different. Handle that by using the url counter for all additional files with the same name.

### IMPROVEMENTS

 * Ensure log file path exists - [#758](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/758)


## 1.4.1 (June 14, 2016)

### BUG FIXES

 * PowerShell v2 assembly was not loading. There was a dependency on an incorrect version of PowerShell assemblies, causing it to only attempt to load System.Management.Automation v3 and above - [#799](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/799)

## 1.3.2 (May 28, 2016)

### BUG FIXES

 * Get-WebFile name changes related to [#753](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/753)

### IMPROVEMENTS

 * Clarified options with version and better messaging.


## 1.3.1 (May 9, 2016)

### BUG FIXES

 * Get-WebFile name changes related to [#727](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/727)

### IMPROVEMENTS

 * Report directory switch override.


## 1.3.0 (May 2, 2016)

### FEATURES

 * Ubiquitous Install Directory Switch! When working with properly formed packages that use Install-ChocolateyPackage (or Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage), Chocolatey is able to override the native installer's directory from one single option you provide to Chocolatey. You no longer need to know what the installer type is and provide that through install arguments. See `choco install -?` and `--install-directory` option for details.
 * Generic Virus Scanner - for organizations that don't want to run checks using VirusTotal, we've provided a way for organizations to use their own virus scanner. See `choco config list` for details.

 ### BUG FIXES

* Fix - Content Length check may error if original location is changed. This means the permanent download location will not error on other checks.
* Fix - Original remote file name can be affected if original url has changed or is unavailable.

### IMPROVEMENTS

 * Virus Scanner exits as soon as possible on files too big for the scanner. If the file is over 500MB, the scanner cannot upload the file, so it should not ask whether it can try to upload prior to failing on the size check (previous behavior).


## 1.2.0 (March 14, 2016)

### FEATURES

 * Virus scanning for Pro users! See the [post](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ferventcoder/chocolatey-the-alternative-windows-store-like-yum/posts/1518468) for details!


## 1.1.0 (February 12, 2016)

### IMPROVEMENTS

 * License can now be in user profile (like `c:\Users\yourname\chocolatey.license.xml`). This is great for roaming user profiles and in multiple machine usage scenarios.
 * Download cache can be controlled with a feature flag and/or a command option. See `choco feature` and `choco install -h` for more details.

### For BETA Testers

 * Virus Check improvements
   * Throw if virus check has not been done before.
   * Messaging is clarified
   * Skip or run virus check with command options - see `choco install -h` for details.


## 1.0.2 (February 5, 2016)

### BUG FIXES

* Fix - PowerShell 5 respects Cmdlet aliases, causing overrides on functions not ready (Install-ChocolateyPackage). See the [post](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ferventcoder/chocolatey-the-alternative-windows-store-like-yum/posts/1484093) for details.


## 1.0.1 (February 2, 2016)
